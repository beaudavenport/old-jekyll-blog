Hey there! My name is Beau, and I'm a web developer in St. Louis, Missouri. I build MVC 
web applications, mostly in the Javascript stack, with an emphasis on Front-End functionality. 
My work also incorporates Ruby on Rails as well as Responsive Design, both bootstrap-based and using
CSS3 and SASS. 

When I'm not writing code or learning a new framework, I'm usually roasting coffee, 
kayaking, or climbing.

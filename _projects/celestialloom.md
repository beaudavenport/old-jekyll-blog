The Celestial Loom is an e-commerce and astrological information website.  Built with Jekyll, it uses flat-file
collections to populate pages for available services and information about the Zodiac.  Dynamically rendered hosted
PayPal buttons provide secure off-site checkout with no sensitive information persistence. Bootstrap and jQuery are
used for client-side validation and order confirmation with a responsive UX across devices.

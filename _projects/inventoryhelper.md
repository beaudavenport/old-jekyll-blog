Inventory Helper is an application for calculating and saving coffee inventory 
in a roasting facility or coffee shop. It implements a REST-ful back-end with express.js 
and MongoDB, and a stateful front-end with backbone.js. The UI leverages bootstrap 
for responsive usability on any device. JSON web tokens are used for authentication 
and bcrypt for node is used for password hashing.

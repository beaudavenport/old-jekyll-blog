Hey there! My name is Beau, and I'm a software engineer in St. Louis, Missouri. I specialize in React.js and Javascript generally,
both client-side and server side, as well as .NET, with an emphasis in cloud-based technologies.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually roasting coffee, 
kayaking, climbing, or spending time with my wife and two boys.
